# EA Multiclipboard

Multiclibboard is a convenient productivity enhancer to provide multiple clips from the clip history. This project is made to learn Python.

### Things that I've used and learned.

- Differences between venv and virtualvenv
  venv is included in Python 3 and newer and is the preferred way to create and manage virtual enviroments. source: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

- Library called: clipboard https://pypi.org/project/clipboard/

- Importance of `__name__ == "__main__"` when my program/script is used by another program.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do
